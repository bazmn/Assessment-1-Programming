Look for important information in labs that look useful to the task
these can be:
  Arrays
  Switch 
  Arguments
  TESTING FOR CERTAIN THINGS
Also there is an exam due on friday so I need to study for that

Right now I believe I'll pproach the rotation cypher by testing for common words, or just rotating the numbers, testing until one finally works
As for the substitution cypher
  Start easy (as with everything)
  Gaurentee the pass! Don't get fancy

Cheatsheet for Arrays::

/* Main function of the C program. */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    
    char array[] = "Hello whats doin"; // char = NUMBERS AND CHARACTERS
        //the array is literally whats in that^
    
    printf("%c\n", array[8]); // This prints the 8th figure of the array which is a (this is because the counting starts from 0. %c is used for caracters)
    
    int i = 0; 
    
    while(i<10)
    {
        printf("%c", array[i]); // This will print the whole array
        
        if(array[i] == 'a') // If a certain carachter or number was to be found in the array, this will trigger the if statement
        {
            printf("We found the A!");
        }
        
        i++;
    }
    
    printf("%s\n", array); // This just prints the whole array or "String". %s is used for the whole string
    
    char x = 0;
    
  char test[26]; // This just creates space for 26 COMPLETLY RANDOM chars.
  
  
  test[2] = 15; // This will force the 2nd char of the array to = 15
  

  
  printf("%d", test[2]); // This will print the 2nd char of the array. If not initialised, it will be a random number
}
